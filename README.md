<p> :grin: Here are the programming principles I follow:
  <ol>
    <li> :books: General principles </li>
      <ul>
        <li> KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid </li>
        <li> YAGNI: You Aren't Going to Need It: don't implement something until it is necessary </li>
        <li> DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself </li>
        <li> Boy Scout Rule: always leave the code cleaner than we found it </li>
        <li> Avoid Premature Optimization</li>
      </ul>
    <li> :fireworks: Design principles </li>
      <ul>
        <li> BDUF: Big Design Upfront: design the project first and implement it later </li>
        <li> Measure Twice and Cut Once: plan and prepare thoroughly and carefully before you take an action </li>
      </ul>
    <li> :eyeglasses: Class/Module principles </li>
      <ul> 
        <li> Separation of concerns: separate a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern </li>
        <li> SOLID's 5 principles </li>
        <li> Minimise Coupling </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
